            <h2>Experiment Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> To study the integration of an advanced prosthetic right hand with a protogen's natural systems. The prosthetic hand is designed with artificial muscles, sensory feedback systems, and advanced cybernetic components to match the natural dexterity of the protogen's remaining organic limbs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Primary Goal:</strong> Test the prosthetic's effectiveness in restoring full functionality and seamless coordination with the protogen's other cybernetic and organic body parts.

            <h2>Experiment Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>[Day 1]</strong> Prosthetic right hand integrated with neural system. Initial tests show slight latency in response time.</li>
                <li><strong>[Day 3]</strong> Improved synchronization between organic left hand and cybernetic right hand. Minor discomfort reported in prosthetic interface.</li>
                <li><strong>[Day 7]</strong> Subject exhibits full dexterity with prosthetic hand. Can perform complex tasks such as typing, lifting, and fine manipulation.</li>
                <li><strong>[Day 14]</strong> Subject reports no issues with the prosthetic. Enhanced tactile feedback is now fully integrated into the protogen's nervous system.</li>
                <li><strong>[Day 30]</strong> Subject begins to utilize the prosthetic hand for combat training, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness in coordination with both hands.</li>

            <h2>Subject Origin</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creation Site:</strong> [REDACTED] Research Facility, located in [REDACTED] zone.</li>
                <li><strong>Backstory:</strong> Protogen-Delta was originally a standard model of a protogen, but following a traumatic injury to the right arm, the subject underwent extensive modification to enhance its survivability. The prosthetic hand was designed not only to replace the lost limb but to improve overall dexterity and combat potential by integrating cybernetic enhancements.</li>

        <section class="experiment-conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The experiment demonstrates the successful integration of a prosthetic right hand with a protogen's organic body. The prosthetic is fully functional, with no reported malfunctions or rejections by the body. The subject is able to use both hands in complex tasks, such as detailed manual work and combat training, without noticeable difference in performance between the organic and cybernetic limbs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further enhancements to the prosthetic are possible, focusing on increasing the sensory feedback to the user, as well as augmenting its strength and endurance in extreme environments. Additional experiments are needed to explore long-term neural integration and the potential for future upgrades.
