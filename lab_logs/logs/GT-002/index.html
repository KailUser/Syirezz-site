            <h2>Experiment Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> To analyze the viability and adaptability of a hybrid organism created from 
                shark DNA, candle wax genetic materials, and human volunteer (D-139A). The experiment focuses on 
                bioluminescence and aquatic mobility in deep-sea environments.

            <h2>Experiment Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>[Day 1]</strong> Subject successfully stabilized post-creation. Initial testing shows glowing fins activating in low-light environments.</li>
                <li><strong>[Day 30]</strong> Subject displayed heightened aggression when exposed to volcanic thermal vents.</li>
                <li><strong>[Day 75]</strong> Bioluminescent fins exhibit irregular pulsations during feeding cycles. Behavior suggests possible communication attempt.</li>
                <li><strong>[Day 120]</strong> Subject escaped containment briefly. Security measures reinforced. Noted signs of cognitive development beyond expectations.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="experiment-origin">
            <h2>Subject Origin</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Birthplace:</strong> [REDACTED]</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Backstory:</strong> Subject was created using genetic materials from a shark, candle wax-based enzymes, 
                    and genetic contributions from volunteer D-139A. The hybrid mutation process was initiated in a deep-sea lab near [REDACTED]. 
                    Bioluminescent algae exposure and thermal vents contributed to the unique glow and adaptive traits.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Subject "Glowing Terror" demonstrates remarkable potential for adaptive survival in extreme aquatic environments. 
                However, increased aggression and advanced cognition present containment challenges. Further research is required 
                to understand bioluminescence communication and behavioral unpredictability.
