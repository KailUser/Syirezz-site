            <h2>Experiment Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> To integrate a cybernetic heart into a bio-organic prototype to enhance endurance, strength, and resilience. The heart implant was designed to replace the biological heart, functioning both as a circulatory and energy source for enhanced physical capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Primary Goal:</strong> Successfully replace the prototype's failing organic heart with a high-output cybernetic heart, capable of increasing endurance in combat and extreme environmental conditions.

            <h2>Experiment Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>[Day 1]</strong> Heart replacement surgery successfully completed. Prototype-Alpha remains stable. Initial integration with cybernetic heart seems promising, though subject reports minor discomfort in the chest area.</li>
                <li><strong>[Day 3]</strong> Increased energy output noted, but subject is still experiencing irregular pulses and heightened internal heat. System diagnostics show minor failures in heart-to-body energy transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>[Day 7]</strong> Subject's biological functions begin to deteriorate. Energy output from the cybernetic heart seems to be inconsistent, with brief power surges that lead to body temperature spikes and convulsions. Doctors are concerned about the stability of the implant.</li>
                <li><strong>[Day 10]</strong> Failure of the neural interface with the heart implant. Subject has gone into a semi-conscious state, exhibiting signs of both cybernetic and biological rejection. Attempts to stabilize the system have failed.</li>
                <li><strong>[Day 12]</strong> Heart implant malfunction causes system shutdown. Prototype-Alpha is now in a dormant state, exhibiting low power and unstable bio-signals. Emergency protocols activated to prevent further damage to the subject.</li>
                <li><strong>[Day 13]</strong> **Incident Report: Security Guard Fatality**  
                During a routine security check, a guard approached the dormant Prototype-Alpha's containment unit. A sudden and unanticipated power surge from the cybernetic heart activated the subject's internal systems. In an instant, the security guard was caught in a violent electrical discharge, instantly killing him. Video footage shows the guard’s body convulsing as his own heartbeat was overridden by the pulse from Prototype-Alpha's malfunctioning heart. The body was found with severe burns, and the power surge was traced back to the cybernetic heart's unstable core. Further investigations are ongoing.</li>

        <section class="experiment-origin">
            <h2>Subject Origin</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creation Site:</strong> [REDACTED] Research Lab, Zone 7</li>
                <li><strong>Backstory:</strong> Prototype-Alpha was originally a military-grade biotechnological soldier, designed for high-intensity operations. After suffering severe organ failure during an operation, it was selected for an experimental heart replacement procedure in hopes of increasing performance. However, due to the untested nature of the cybernetic heart, the operation has resulted in catastrophic failure.</li>

        <section class="experiment-conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The experiment has failed. The integration of the cybernetic heart into Prototype-Alpha's system caused irreparable damage to both the prototype's biological and cybernetic systems. The subject is currently in a critical state, with no signs of full recovery in sight. Further investigation is needed to understand the cause of the rejection and failure of the cybernetic implant.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cybernetic heart, while theoretically a breakthrough in energy management, proved to be incompatible with the prototype’s biological systems. Attempts to stabilize the heart through external power sources and recalibration have been unsuccessful.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of now, the prototype remains dormant in the lab, awaiting further examination. It is unclear if the subject will ever recover or if the experiment can be salvaged with new modifications.
